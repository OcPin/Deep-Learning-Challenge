# Deep-Learning-Challenge

Module 21 Challenge

This module focused on machine learning via nerual networks and predicting outcomes.

There are two files of the model's code:

AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb
AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb

These files are of the models used to predict the outcomes of wether a company will or will not be successful when backed by Alphabet Soup.

The two other files are of the models themselves:

AlphabetSoupCharity.h5
AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5
